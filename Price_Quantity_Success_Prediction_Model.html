								<h2>Summary:</h2>
								<p>It's a predictive model for the quantities required to be sold for a product with X price and Y cost considering the multiple costs of the business and the complexities of the Argentinian tax system. Inversely, the model can also calculate which price a product should be sold for if you expect to sell X number of units. My client has authorized me to show this work sample, on the condition that I censored some of the details to maintain certain business functionalities and advantages private.</p>
								<p>The file has different tabs that help calculate the fixed and percentage business costs, the taxes needed to be paid, the amount of such costs that each unit of the current calculation should absorb, and the total made by the business with every product.</p>
								<h2>Price and Cost predicted scenario:</h2>
								<p>This is one of the main tabs to calculate a predicted scenario, but it's fairly simple to use by design. My employer only needed to change the “Unit Price” and “Unit Cost” highlighted in light blue and the excel file will do everything else.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Price_Quantity_Success_Prediction_Model\Model_Showcase.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Quantities sold predicted scenario</h2>
								<p>This is the other main tab, according to the number of units expected to be sold, it calculates the prices when it achieves profit. For the calculation is important to input an "initial price" that is the lowest price you expect to sell this for, a "price jump" that the model uses to increase the price for each calculation, an "initial cost", a "cost jump", and finally the number of units sold, all fields highlighted in light blue.</p>

								<h2>The Equation:</h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Price_Quantity_Success_Prediction_Model\equation.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is the main equation, its results are shown in the “Return” plot for the "Price and Cost predicted scenario", the other main tab uses a variation of it. I highlight it to prove it was complex and it required mathematical and business experience to create and ensure it was correct. And as such, I think it's the best thing I did with this model and the reason for its creation.</p>
								<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
								<p>There is no model that can perfectly predict or simulate the multiple scenarios every business faces day to day, but certain models like this one allow us to improve our strategic decision-making, speeds-up necessary calculations, and help us decide between similar but different propositions. For these reasons, and the general reduction of uncertainty we obtain when using them is why these types of models are so valuable.</p>
