								</ul>

								<h3>Objective:</h3>
								<p>Use data on smart device usage and customer health from non-Bellabeat smart
									devices to help Bellabeat customers and improve the marketing strategy.</p>

								<h2>Data characteristics</h2>
								<p>This dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 and it's from <strong>30</strong> Fitbit users that consented to the submission of personal tracker data (CC0: Public Domain).</p>
								<p><bold>Link:</bold> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit</p>

								<p>As you can see the biggest problem with the dataset is its limited amount of users, with just 30 users for the sample size we cannot say with confidence that the findings from the analysis will apply to the actual amount of customers much less to the <strong>potential</strong> customers. </p>
								<p>Additionally, since the dataset is so precise I could not obtain additional data with a creative commons license to add to the data pool. For these reasons all the findings made in this analysis will be for the information that we have available and cannot be expected to be replicated in the whole population with precision.</p>

								<h2>Data cleanup and transformation</h2>
								<p>The data is distributed between 18 CSV files from different sizes, some of which have too many rows for Excel to fully display them. For this reason, I will be using SSMS (SQL) and python for data cleanup and transformation.</p>
								<p>The date format in the original files where not compatible with the date format used by SSMS, so I will use python code to change the date format:
								</p>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\python_datechange_code.png" alt="" /></div>
								
								<p>Once uploaded the files to SSMS an initial inspection reveals 2 things, first, there are a couple of rows where every minute of a day is sedentary (1440). This is very strange, since sleeping 24 hours a day is not something healthy people do, and since the data does not come from anyone with particularly hard health problems we can assume that they forgot to use their smart device that day or the battery run out. Second, it may be wise to check if all minutes of the day from the columns that count active and sedentary minutes add up to 1440.</p>
								<p>For an initial data exploration, I used the following SQL code:</p>
								<div class = "box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_1.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_2.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_3.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
										<!-- Break -->
										<div class="col-3"><span class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_4.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>From left to right: look for all rows where all the minutes were sedentary, look for all rows where there were no total steps, look for a specific user that had multiple rows with all sedentary minutes but a lot of total steps, and finally, all rows ordered by sedentary minutes to see if rows with 1400 sedentary minutes or an equally high number also presented a strange amount of total steps or an outlier in another column.</p>
								<p>After that, I discover that not only there are 77 rows with 0 total steps, but also 7 rows with thousands of steps but somehow 1440 sedentary minutes, and 4 rows with 0 calories burned, 0 steps, and 1440 sedentary minutes that day.</p>
								<p>All rows described here should be deleted or have their values replaced, the 7 rows that have data on the number of steps but have the entire day as sedentary could be attributed to traveling with the device turned on, but without wearing it, in this case, the device will count the distance as steps but not the heart rate. This is proved by the fact that all the rows <strong>except</strong> the ones measuring distance are 0.</p>
								<p>In this case, we cannot replace the values since we don't have enough data, each user has at most 31 rows of data, each row representing a day. If we have missing data on a Monday for example, we normally could look at the data on that same day or as a hole and try to figure out a pattern for that user, but in this case, we only have another 4 rows of the same day of the week for that user so we cannot replace the data with close to accurate information. For these reasons, the rows mentioned before should be deleted.</p>
								<div class = "box alt">
									<span class="image right"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_5.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<p>To finish with the data exploration I counted the number of minutes registered by the device to see if every row had 1440 minutes in total.</p>
								<p>Around half of the rows have less than 1440 minutes total, some further exploration revealed that there isn't any row with more than 1440 minutes. This means that at least not every device in the dataset counts the minutes by having 1440 minutes total and decreasing it when registering an activity that's not sedentary. Further proven by the fact that not all devices measure sleep the same way since the "sleepDay" table has less than half the amount of rows that the total dataset.</p>
								<div class = "box alt bottom margin">
									<span class="image right"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_6.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Now it would be important for the sake of data cleanup to check what's the state of the rows with the same id and date as the one with 1440 sedentary minutes.</p>
								</div>
								<p>It would take too much time to search each row in this way, instead, I'm going to search for each of the rows that are in the 1440 sedentary minute selection, and using an INNER JOIN I will retrieve every row that has relevant data in another table.
									For example, using the "minuteSteps" table I will retrieve every row that has 1440 sedentary minutes in the "dailyActivity" table and more than 0 steps in the "minuteSteps" table:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_7.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>We can use the same type of query for other tables, which reveals when used in the "dailyIntensities" table that there wasn't any type of physical activity, light or otherwise, on any of those days. Without a single step in the whole day, we can safely say that the device was not being used at that time or its battery was depleted.</p>
								<p>With a slight modification to the SELECT statement from before we will use a DELETE statement changing the name of the table we want to delete the rows from and the column in the CONVERT function when appropriate.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_8.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>To finish, we will delete the rows from the dailyActivity table:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_9.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>This is the time when our past decisions pay off. Since we modified the original CSV files with python instead of changing them in the database, we now have each table in the database with some deleted rows that represent the proper use of the devices, and we also have the tables with all the data proper use or otherwise.</p>
								<p>When completing the last DELETE query SSMS informs us how many rows were deleted, but we can also know this using a query like the following in both the original table and the edited one:</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\exploration_SQL_10.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>With this, we know that there are 861 rows of proper use against 940 of the original table, this gives us 79 rows of improper use. Better yet, this shows us that ~ 8% of days a device is not used as intended, this is not an average and changes with each user but it does show us the first clue for an improvement in our products: a set of alarms, or reminders as well as additional features or products like a small battery that can be strapped in the arm to charge the smartwatch without taking it off.</p>
								<p>Closing the gap between proper and improper device use days will allow our clients to get more accurate information on their health and will allow us to market our products as the most precise available.</p>
								<p>From now on we will be using a lot of R for exploration, visualization, and analysis.</p>
								<p>For starters here are a couple of graphs of all the calories burned each day. As you can see, some users (represented by each graph) have very few days, this is not because we deleted the rest, but because not all provided 31 days of data, for example, one of the users, the second from the third row, provided just 4 days of data.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_1.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Besides the basic utility of the devices or documenting each day, there is information that can be obtained from the habits developed by the user, and we can make the users aware of such information to further improve their habits. One way to do this is to use the calories burned detected by the device for each day, group it by week, and finally compare every week for the month. Since the most data we have is 31 days per user we will use the whole dataset instead of 1 month.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_2.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>For example, if the user of this dataset wanted to have a more active lifestyle, the user would see that Sundays are consistently a day when they burned the least calories, and as such a possible good day to increase physical activity. Additionally, there is no need to leave any analysis to the user, the device could calculate which day of the week constantly has the least calories burned, or the least amount of active minutes and inform the user.</p>						
								<p>Here we have 2 examples of how it might look, one with a very similar average for each day and another one that differs a bit more.</p>
								<div class = "box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_3.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_4.PNG" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Next, I will analyze the activities' intensity and their calories consumption, this will assist the user in figuring out what is the best activity for burning calories from the ones they are already developing, and in which moments they are the least active throughout the day so they can avoid them. An initial investigation of this topic revealed interesting information.</p>
								<p>This next graph shows the calories burned in an hour and the total intensity achieved in the same hour, since the different data points were so scattered, I added a color distinction for each user to see if that explained it.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_5.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>It's a bit hard to pick up on it but the distinction is there, adding a fitted regression model line for each user and making the scatter points the same color as the background clearly reveals it.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_6.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Having this information we can suggest users with lower Calories burned - Intensity ratio to do more hours of low-intensity training, and try to avoid extremely sedentary activities for long hours. Additionally, we can suggest users with this characteristic that want to avoid losing weight focus on high-intensity short activities to keep themself fit.</p>
								<p>Lastly, we can help our users know how their routine is composed, what activities demand the highest intensity and what are the times of highest relaxation. Reporting these data each week or each day will allow our users to determine if they prefer to concentrate on one sport or another depending on their objectives or what times from each day are good to fill with a bit more of physical activity.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="Recursos\Bellabeat_smartdevice_marketing\analysis_R_7.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<h3>For the Bellabeat Ad campaign and marketing:</h3>
								<p>The Bellabeat app can make suggestions not only on a normal routine but can also adapt as it gathers more information to more precisely provide advice on exercise, calorie intake, and habits.</p>
								<p>Summarizing the ideas presented before, the app could:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Remind the user to charge it and develop a habit of using the device to provide the most accurate information.</li>
									<li>Consider the routine and objectives of the user and provide the user with data on their calorie consumption each week for them to know when they succeed in approaching their ideal routine and habits and which days are open for improvement.</li>
									<li>Suggest to the user the amount and intensity of the activities they should take part in according to their Calories spent - Intensity ratio.</li>
									<li>Provide the user information on the intensity of each hour of their day for them to know if the activities that they are doing are in line with their objectives and which hours of each day they have the most sedentary activity.</li>
				
								</ul>
